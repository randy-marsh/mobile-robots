%% Path Following for a Differential Drive Robot
%% Introduction
% This example demonstrates how to control a robot to follow a desired path
% using a Robot Simulator. The example uses the Pure Pursuit path following
% controller to drive a simulated robot along a predetermined path. A desired path is a
% set of waypoints defined explicitly or computed using a path planner (refer to
% <docid:robotics_examples.example-PathPlanningExample>). The Pure Pursuit
% path following controller for a simulated differential drive robot is created and
% computes the control commands to follow a given path. The computed control commands are
% used to drive the simulated robot along the desired trajectory to
% follow the desired path based on the Pure Pursuit controller.
%
% Note: Starting in R2016b, instead of using the step method to perform the
% operation defined by the System object, you can call the object with
% arguments, as if it were a function. For example, |y = step(obj,x)| and
% |y = obj(x)| perform equivalent operations.

%% Define Waypoints
% Define a set of waypoints for the desired path for the robot

path = [14.00    11.00;
    16.25    12.75;
    20.25    14.25;
    18.25    16.75;
    19.75   18.75;
    19.00   19.00];

% Set the current location and the goal location of the robot as defined by the path
robotCurrentLocation = path(1,:);
robotGoal = path(end,:);

%%
% Assume an initial robot orientation (the robot orientation is the angle
% between the robot heading and the positive X-axis, measured
% counterclockwise).
initialOrientation = 0;

%%
% Define the current pose for the robot [x y theta]
robotCurrentPose = [robotCurrentLocation initialOrientation];

%% Initialize the Robot Simulator
% A simple robot simulator is used in this example that updates and
% returns the pose of the differential drive robot for given control inputs. An external
% simulator or a physical robot will require a localization mechanism to
% provide an updated pose of the robot.

%%
% Initialize the robot simulator and assign an initial pose. The simulated
% robot has kinematic equations for the motion of a two-wheeled differential drive robot.
% The inputs to this simulated robot are linear and angular velocities. It also has plotting
% capabilities to display the robot's current location and draw the
% trajectory of the robot.

robotRadius = 0.4;
robot = ExampleHelperRobotSimulator('emptyMap',2);
robot.enableLaser(false);
robot.setRobotSize(robotRadius);
robot.showTrajectory(true);
robot.setRobotPose(robotCurrentPose);

%%
% Visualize the desired path
plot(path(:,1), path(:,2),'k--d')
xlim([0 13])
ylim([0 13])

%% Define the Path Following Controller
% Based on the path defined above and a robot motion model, you need a path
% following controller to drive the robot along the path. Create the path
% following controller using the |<docid:robotics_ref.buoofp1-1 robotics.PurePursuit>| object.
controller = robotics.PurePursuit

%%
% Use the path defined above to set the desired waypoints for the
% controller
controller.Waypoints = path;

%%
% Set the path following controller parameters. The desired linear
% velocity is set to 0.3 meters/second for this example.
controller.DesiredLinearVelocity = 0.3;

%%
% The maximum angular velocity acts as a saturation limit for rotational velocity, which is
% set at 2 radians/second for this example.
controller.MaxAngularVelocity = 2;

%%
% As a general rule, the lookahead distance should be larger than the desired
% linear velocity for a smooth path. The robot might cut corners when the
% lookahead distance is large. In contrast, a small lookahead distance can
% result in an unstable path following behavior. A value of 0.5 m was chosen
% for this example.
controller.LookaheadDistance = 0.5;

%% Using the Path Following Controller, Drive the Robot over the Desired Waypoints
% The path following controller provides input control signals for the
% robot, which the robot uses to drive itself along the desired path.
%
% Define a goal radius, which is the desired distance threshold
% between the robot's final location and the goal location. Once the robot is
% within this distance from the goal, it will stop. Also, you compute the current
% distance between the robot location and
% the goal location. This distance is continuously checked against the goal
% radius and the robot stops when this distance is less than the goal radius.
%
% Note that too small value of the goal radius may cause the robot to miss
% the goal, which may result in an unexpected behavior near the goal.
goalRadius = 0.1;
distanceToGoal = norm(robotCurrentLocation - robotGoal);

%%
% The |<docid:robotics_ref.buoofp1-1 controller>| object computes control commands for the robot.
% Drive the robot using these control commands until it reaches within the
% goal radius. If you are using an external simulator or a physical robot,
% then the controller outputs should be applied to the robot and a localization
% system may be required to update the pose of the robot. The controller runs at 10 Hz.
controlRate = robotics.Rate(10);
while( distanceToGoal > goalRadius )
    
    % Compute the controller outputs, i.e., the inputs to the robot
    [v, omega] = controller(robot.getRobotPose);
    
    % Simulate the robot using the controller outputs.
    drive(robot, v, omega);
    
    % Extract current location information ([X,Y]) from the current pose of the
    % robot
    robotCurrentPose = robot.getRobotPose;
    
    % Re-compute the distance to the goal
    distanceToGoal = norm(robotCurrentPose(1:2) - robotGoal);
    
    waitfor(controlRate);
    
end

%% Using the Path Following Controller Along with PRM
% If the desired set of waypoints are computed by a path planner, the path
% following controller can be used in the same fashion.

% Start Robot Simulator with a simple map
robot = ExampleHelperRobotSimulator('simpleMap',2);
robot.enableLaser(false);
robot.setRobotSize(robotRadius);
robot.showTrajectory(true);

%%
% You can compute the |path| using the PRM path planning algorithm. See
% <docid:robotics_examples.example-PathPlanningExample> for details.

mapInflated = copy(robot.Map);
inflate(mapInflated,robotRadius);
prm = robotics.PRM(mapInflated);
prm.NumNodes = 100;
prm.ConnectionDistance = 10;

%%
% Find a path between the start and end location. Note that the |path| will
% be different due to the probabilistic nature of the PRM algorithm.
startLocation = [2.0 1.0];
endLocation = [12.0 10.0];
path = findpath(prm, startLocation, endLocation)

%%
% Display the path
show(prm, 'Map', 'off', 'Roadmap', 'off');

%%
% You defined a path following controller above which you can re-use
% for computing the control commands of a robot on this map. To
% re-use the controller and redefine the waypoints while keeping the other
% information the same, use the |release| function.
release(controller);
controller.Waypoints = path;

%%
% Set current location and the goal of the robot as defined by the path
robotCurrentLocation = path(1,:);
robotGoal = path(end,:);

%%
% Assume an initial robot orientation
initialOrientation = 0;

%%
% Define the current pose for robot motion [x y theta]
robotCurrentPose = [robotCurrentLocation initialOrientation];

%%
% Reset the current position of the simulated robot to the start of the path.
robot.setRobotPose(robotCurrentPose);

%%
% <<path_starting_position_part2.png>>
%
%%
% Compute distance to the goal location
distanceToGoal = norm(robotCurrentLocation - robotGoal);

%%
% Define a goal radius
goalRadius = 0.1;

%%
% Drive the robot using the controller output on the given map until it
% reaches the goal. The controller runs at 10 Hz.
reset(controlRate);
while( distanceToGoal > goalRadius )
    
    % Compute the controller outputs, i.e., the inputs to the robot
    [v, omega] = controller(robot.getRobotPose);
    
    % Simulate the robot using the controller outputs
    drive(robot, v, omega);
    
    % Extract current location information from the current pose
    robotCurrentPose = robot.getRobotPose;
    
    % Re-compute the distance to the goal
    distanceToGoal = norm(robotCurrentPose(1:2) - robotGoal);
    
    waitfor(controlRate);
end

% The simulated robot has reached the goal location using the path following
% controller along the desired path. Stop the robot.
